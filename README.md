## Game Description
In case you are unfamiliar, here is how the game works:

* There are two players in this game.
* Each player has the option of choosing either rock or paper or scissors.
* In the event both players choose the same option, the game is a draw.
* On the other hand, if the players choose different things, then one will win and the other will lose.

Game rules are:
* rock vs scissors: rock will win (rock crushes scissors)
* rock vs paper: paper will win (paper covers rock)
* scissors vs paper: scissors will win (scissors cuts paper)

## Project Description
Here's how our project works:

In this game, the user will play against the computer.  
Randomly, the computer will pick either rock, paper, or scissors.  
It will be unknown to the user what the computer chooses.  
The user will be offered to choose either rock, paper or scissors.  
By comparing the computer's pick with the user's pick, we will be able to determine whether the user won, lost,or drew.
